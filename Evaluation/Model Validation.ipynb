    "One disadvantage of using a holdout set for model validation is that we have lost a portion of our data to the model training.\n",
    "In the above case, half the dataset does not contribute to the training of the model!\n",
    "This is not optimal, and can cause problems â€“ especially if the initial set of training data is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to address this is to use *cross-validation*; that is, to do a sequence of fits where each subset of the data is used both as a training set and as a validation set.\n",
    "Visually, it might look something like this:\n",
